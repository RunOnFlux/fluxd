Description: flux libraries and tools
 Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard
 of privacy and anonymity through a sophisticiated zero-knowledge
 proving scheme which preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata.
 Think of it as HTTPS for money.
 This package provides the daemon, fluxd, and the CLI tool,
 flux-cli, to interact with the daemon.
