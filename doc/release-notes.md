Notable changes
===============

UTXO memory accounting
----------------------

The default -dbcache has been changed in this release to 450MiB. Users can set -dbcache to a higher value (e.g. to keep the UTXO set more fully cached in memory). Users on low-memory systems (such as systems with 1GB or less) should consider specifying a lower value for this parameter.

Additional information relating to running on low-memory systems can be found here: [reducing-memory-usage.md](https://github.com/zelcash/zelcash/blob/master/doc/reducing-memory-usage.md).
